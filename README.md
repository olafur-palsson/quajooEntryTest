## Run the database

Go to server directory and use `dotnet run`

## Running the app

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

## What I learned

#### C# 

Syntax

Dotnet (sending request, receiving request, working with json, CORS)


#### Javascript

My google geocoder that I wrote 2 years ago is horrible.

Finding a good geocoder API is tricky.

Documentation for geocoders is often out of date.

There are still API's force you to use globals. (Like, why?)


#### OpenWeather

This is a nice freemium API.

Only allows 60 requests per day.

Supports lat lon.


#### Devops

I need to take some time to learn docker when I'm not under time pressure to do it.
That is, figure out how to get into a place where I can basically delpoy an app
on ubuntu via script.


##### People skills

It's important to read the requirements often. I forget what they where so
it's important to refresh my memore before I start working so I don't start
doing something that is not requsted.
